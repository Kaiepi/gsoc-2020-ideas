## Adding ideas

To add project ideas create a pull request for this repository.  Just copy the
[project idea template](project_template.md) into the [`perl`](perl) or [`raku`](raku) directory
(or create a new one if it does not fit exactly in any of them) and fill it
out. Use a separate file for each project idea.  Please also add your project
idea to the *Project ideas* list above, itemized. If you have an idea but no
mentor or the idea is not entirely fleshed out, add it to *incomplete project
ideas* and try to complete it. Ideas without a mentor will have to be removed
before this list is submitted to Google.

Project ideas need to meet certain criteria described [on this Google
page](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/defining-a-project-ideas-list).
When you use the template you should be good to go. If you have an idea and
want to discuss it before adding anything, [discuss it here or add a new
issue](https://github.com/perl-foundation-outreach/gsoc-2020-ideas/issues/1).

## Perl and Raku mailing lists

* Here's a list of [Perl mailing lists](https://lists.perl.org/),
  with
  [this Perl specific list for beginners](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.beginners/).
* [Raku users gather in these mailing lists](https://raku.org/archive/lists/),
  with
  [perl6-users](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/) the
  main general-purpose list.
  
## Perl and Raku IRC sites
 
* Perl has its own IRC hosting site,
  with
  [this list of channels](http://www.irc.perl.org/channels.html). `#perl-help`
  is the best place for beginners.
* Raku has a series
  of
  [IRC channels, with bots attached](https://raku.org/community/irc),
  with `#raku` on Freenode being the best channel for beginners.
